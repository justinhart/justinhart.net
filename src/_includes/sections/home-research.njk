            My research aims to enable robots to operate fluently in human
            environments, with the long-term goal of deploying interactive
            service robots in homes and workplaces. My lab studies how robots
            can interact effectively with people and function robustly in 
            places designed for people rather than for machines. This work
            draws on models of human behavior, system architectures for
            autonomy, and perception. To study these questions in practice, I
            build and field integrated robotic systems that combine machine
            learning, foundation models, large language models, and semantic
            mapping and perception.
