        <h1 class="mb-3">How to Join My Lab</h1>

        <p class="mb-4">
            Thank you for your interest in the Living with Robots Laboratory!
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          Please read this page carefully before reaching out.
        </p>

        <hr class="my-4">

        <h2 class="mb-3">PhD Students</h2>

        <p class="mb-3">
          I recruit PhD students <strong>exclusively through the official UT Austin
          Computer Science admissions process</strong>, which occurs once per year
          with applications due in December.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-3">
          To ensure fairness and to avoid creating misleading expectations, I do not
          provide pre-application evaluations, assess candidacy by email, or offer
          individualized feedback outside the formal admissions process.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-3">
          When reviewing PhD applications, I consider the full applicant pool and
          place particular emphasis on:
        </p>

        <ul class="mb-4">
          <li>Strong academic preparation</li>
          <li>Prior research experience</li>
          <li>
            Publications in major robotics venues such as
            ICRA, IROS, HRI, or RO-MAN
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mb-4">
          If you decide to apply and are interested in working with me, please list
          me as a prospective advisor in the <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/graduate/apply">application system</a>.
        </p>

        <hr class="my-4">

        <h2 class="mb-3">Postdoctoral Researchers</h2>

        <p class="mb-3">
          I hire postdoctoral researchers on a case-by-case basis, typically tied
          to specific funded projects.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-3">
          Strong candidates generally have a completed PhD in robotics, AI, or a
          closely related field, along with a strong publication record and experience
          building or deploying real robotic systems.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          If you believe your background aligns closely with my work, you may reach
          out by email with a concise description of your research and interests.
        </p>

        <hr class="my-4">

        <h2 class="mb-3">Master's Students</h2>

        <div class="mb-3">
            I <b>do</b> work with masters students in my laboratory. Master's
            students should already be admitted to an in-person master's
            program prior to reaching out to me, and must do a semester of work
            in my laboratory before I approve thesis supervision (except in
            cases where this is impossible, such as due to program
            requirements or time in the program).

            If this describes you, send me the following:
            <ul class="mb-3">
            <li>A CV.</li>
            <li>An unofficial transcript.</li>
            <li>1 paragraph explaining your motivation to pursue research.</li>
            <li>1 paragraph explaining why my laboratory is the correct
                laboratory for you.</li>
            </ul>

        </div>

        <hr class="my-4">

        <h2 class="mb-3">Undergraduate Students</h2>

        <div class="mb-3">
            I participate in the
            <a href="https://fri.cns.utexas.edu">Freshman Research Initiative
            </a>.

            There are two routes into this program:
            <ul class="mb-3">
            <li><a href="https://fri.cns.utexas.edu"><strong>Freshman Research
                Initiative</strong></a>:
              <a href="https://fri.cns.utexas.edu/research-streams/autonomous-robots">
                Autonomous Robots Stream</a></li>
            <li><strong>Accelerated Research Initiative (ARI)</strong></li>
            </ul>
            
            If you are a UT Austin undergraduate who is eligible for FRI, you
            should apply to the FRI program. These programs provide a
            structured pathway into my lab. Please see the FRI website for
            details and apply directly through the program.<br>  <br>
            
            Because I already supervise a full cohort of undergraduates through
            these programs, I very rarely take undergraduates from other
            universities, or host short-term or summer visitors.<br><br>    

            If you are an undergraduate student from a different institution
            who wants to participate in my laboratory - even though I rarely 
            take on students from other universities, please have your
            research supervisor reach out to me directly to coordinate a
            long-term plan.<br><br>

            UT Austin students ineligible for FRI, send me the following:
            <ul class="mb-3">
            <li>A CV.</li>
            <li>An unofficial transcript.</li>
            <li>1 paragraph explaining your motivation to pursue research.</li>
            <li>1 paragraph explaining why my laboratory is the correct
                laboratory for you.</li>
            </ul>

            Bear in mind that there are 5 robotics laboratories participating
            in FRI, and 17 laboratories run by Texas Robotics Core Faculty.
            These labs <b>all</b> take undergraduates.
        </div>

        <hr class="my-4">

        <h2 class="mb-3">High School Students</h2>

        <p class="mb-3">
            Due to time constraints I do not supervise high school students. I
            also do not provide matching to other laboratories or other similar
            services.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          If you later matriculate at UT Austin as an undergraduate, please
          apply to the FRI program.
        </p>

        <hr class="my-4">

        <h2 class="mb-3">Teaching Assistant Positions</h2>

        <p class="mb-3">
          Teaching assistant positions in the Computer Science Department are managed
          centrally by the department.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          The courses I teach are part of the Freshman Research Initiative, which does
          not allocate TA positions.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          I do not have TA positions to offer and am not involved in TA hiring decisions.
        </p>

        <hr class="my-4">

        <p class="small">
          I appreciate your interest in the Living with Robots Laboratory and wish you success in your research pursuits.
        </p>
